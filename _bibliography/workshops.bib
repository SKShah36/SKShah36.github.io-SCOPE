	abstract = {Software architecture description languages offer a convenient way of describing the high-level structure of a software system. Such descriptions facilitate rapid prototyping, code generation and automated analysis. One of the big challenges facing the software community is the design of architecture description languages that are general enough to describe a wide-range of systems, yet detailed enough to capture domain-specific properties and provide a high level of tool automation. This paper presents the multi-paradigm challenges we faced and solutions we built when creating a domain-specific modeling language for software architectures of distributed real-time systems.},

	title = {SpeedPro: A Predictive Multi-Model Approach for Urban Traffic Speed Estimation},
	abstract = {Data generated by GPS-equipped probe vehicles, especially public transit vehicles can be a reliable source for traffic speed estimation. Traditionally, this estimation is done by learning the parameters of a model that describes the relationship between the speed of the probe vehicle and the actual traffic speed. However, such approaches typically suffer from data sparsity issues. Furthermore, most state of the art approaches does not consider the effect of weather and the driver of the probe vehicle on the parameters of the learned model. In this paper, we describe a multivariate predictive multi-model approach called SpeedPro that (a) first identifies similar clusters of operation from the historic data that includes the real-time position of the probe vehicle, the weather data, and anonymized driver identifier, and then (b) uses these different models to estimate the traffic speed in real-time as a function of current weather, driver and probe vehicle speed. When the real-time information is not available our approach uses a different model that uses the historical weather and traffic information for estimation. Our results show that the purely historical data is less accurate than the model that uses the real-time information.},

Electrical protection systems including detection elements such as Distance Relays and actuation elements such as Breakers are designed to protect the system from abnormal operations and arrest failure propagation by rapidly isolating the faulty components. However, failure in the protection devices themselves can and do lead to major system events and fault cascades, often leading to blackouts. This paper augments our past work on Temporal Causal Diagrams (TCD), a modeling formalism designed to help reason about the failure progressions by (a) describing a way to generate the TCD model from the system specification, and (b) understand the system failure dynamics for TCD reasoners by configuring simulation models.},

	abstract = {Wider adoption, availability and ubiquity of wireless networking technologies, integrated sensors, actuators, and edge computing devices is facilitating a paradigm shift by allowing us to transition from traditional statically configured vertical silos of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to next generation CPS that are more open, dynamic and extensible. Fractionated spacecraft, smart cities computing architectures, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clusters, platoon of vehicles on highways are all examples of extensible CPS wherein extensibility is implied by the dynamic aggregation of physical resources, affect of physical dynamics on availability of computing resources, and various multi-domain applications hosted on these systems. However, realization of extensible CPS requires resolving design-time and run-time challenges emanating from properties specific to these systems. In this paper, we first describe different properties of extensible CPS - dynamism, extensibility, remote deployment, security, heterogeneity and resilience. Then we identify different design-time challenges stemming from heterogeneity and resilience requirements. We particularly focus on software heterogeneity arising from availability of various communication middleware. We then present appropriate solutions in the context of a novel domain specific language, which can be used to design resilient systems while remaining agnostic to middleware heterogeneities. We also describe how this language and its features have evolved from our past work. We use a platform of fractionated spacecraft to describe our solution.},

	abstract = {Smart emergency response systems, smart transportation systems, smart parking spaces are some examples of multi-domain smart city systems that require large-scale, open platforms for integration and execution. These platforms illustrate high degree of heterogeneity. In this paper, we focus on software heterogeneity arising from different types of applications. The source of variability among applications stems from (a) timing requirements, (b) rate and volume of data they interact with, and (c) behavior depending on whether they are stateful or stateless. These variations result in applications with different computation models. However, a smart city system can comprise multi-domain applications with different types and therefore computation models. As such, a key challenge that arises is that of integration; we require some mechanism to facilitate integration and interaction between applications that use different computation models. In this paper, we first identify computation models based on different application types. Second, we present a generic computation model and explain how it can map to previously identified computation models. Finally, we briefly describe how the generic computation model fits in our overall smart city platform architecture.},

	abstract = {Transportation management platforms provide communities the ability to integrate the available mobility options and localized transportation demand management policies. A central component of a transportation management platform is the mobility planning application. Given the societal relevance of these platforms, it is necessary to ensure that they operate resiliently. Modularity and extensibility are also critical properties that are required for manageability. Modularity allows to isolate faults easily. Extensibility enables update of policies and integration of new mobility modes or new routing algorithms. However, state of the art mobility planning applications like open trip planner, are monolithic applications, which makes it difficult to scale and modify them dynamically. This paper describes a microservices based modular multi-modal mobility platform Mobilytics, that integrates mobility providers, commuters, and community stakeholders. We describe our requirements, architecture, and discuss the resilience challenges, and how our platform functions properly in presence of failure. Conceivably, the patterns and principles manifested in our system can serve as guidelines for current and future practitioners in this field.},

	abstract = {The web has empowered emergency services to enhance operations by leveraging real-time information about incidents from diverse data sources such as social media. However, the high volume of unstructured data from these diverse sources with varying degrees of veracity challenges the timely extraction and integration of relevant information to summarize the current situation. Existing work on event detection and summarization on social media relates to this challenge of timely extraction of information during an evolving event; however, it is limited in both integrating incomplete information from diverse sources and using the integrated information to dynamically infer knowledge representation of the situation that captures optimal actions (e.g., allocate available finite ambulances to incident regions). In this paper, we present a novel concept of an Uncertain Concept Graph (UCG) that is capable of representing dynamic knowledge regarding a disaster from heterogeneous information sources, the regions of interest, and resources/services required. The information sources, incident regions and resources (ambulances) are represented as nodes while the edges represent the weighted relationships between these nodes based on diverse data sources. We then propose a solution for probabilistic edge inference between nodes in UCG. We model a novel optimization problem for the edge assignment between a service resource to a region node over time trajectory. The output of such structured summarization over time can be valuable for modeling event dynamics in the real world across different smart city operations such as transportation.},
