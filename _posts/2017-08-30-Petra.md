title:      "Privacy Preserving Energy Transactions (PETRA)"
subtitle: "We will be presenting the work on using blockchains for transactive energy platforms at IoT 2017 in October. In the paper we describe Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions (PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for communication, bidding, and trading. "
