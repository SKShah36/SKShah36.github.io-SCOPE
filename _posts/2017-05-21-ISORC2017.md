subtitle: "The emerging Fog Computing paradigm is providing an additional computational layer that enables new capabilities in real-time data-driven applications. The application of Fog Computing is especially interesting in the domain of Smart Grid where it can be used to prove a decentralized application framework that reflects the ongoing trend of distribution of intelligence in Smart Systems. These slides describe  a component-based decentralized computation platform called RIAPS which provides an application architecture for such systems."
