title:      "The Microgrid Control Application Demonstration Using RIAPS Software"
subtitle:   "Our collaborators at North Carolina State University recently developed and demonstrated A distributed power system application is running on 4 RIAPS nodes that shows the initial capabilities of RIAPS platform services. The demonstration shows how distributed synchronization can be implemented.  Three out of the four nodes are connected to a real-time simulator simulating the micro grid. The fourth node is used for logging data. This demo also uses the C37 device actor developed by the Vanderbilt University team as part of the initial capability implementation of RIAPS"
