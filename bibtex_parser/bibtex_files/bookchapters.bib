  Abstract                 = {System-level detection, diagnosis, and mitigation of faults in complex systems that include physical components as well as software are essential to achieve high dependability. The paper introduces a model, referred to as the Timed Failure Propagation Graph (TFPG) that captures the causal propagation of observable fault effects in systems. Several algorithms based on this model have been developed, including: consistency-based centralized and distributed algorithms for multiple-fault fault source isolation in real-time, algorithms to calculate diagnosability metrics, and algorithms to prognosticate impending failures. The model and the associated algorithms are applicable to physical systems but recently they have been applied to component-based software systems as well, where similar fault propagation can take place. The paper describes the modeling paradigm, the algorithms developed, and how they were applied in a system and software context.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we describe a computation platform called ReachLab, which enables automatic analysis of embedded software systems that interact with continuous environment. Algorithms are used to specify how the state space of the system model should be explored in order to perform analysis. In ReachLab, both system models and analysis algorithm models are specified in the same framework using Hybrid System Analysis and Design Language (HADL), which is a meta-model based language. The platform allows the models of algorithms to be constructed hierarchically and promotes their reuse in constructing more complex algorithms. Moreover, the platform is designed in such a way that the concerns of design and implementation of analysis algorithms are separated. On one hand, the models of analysis algorithms are abstract and therefore the design of algorithms can be made independent of implementation details. On the other hand, translators are provided to automatically generate implementations from the models for computing analysis results based on computation kernels. Multiple computation kernels, which are based on specific computation tools such as d/dt and the Level Set toolbox, are supported and can be chosen to enable hybrid state space exploration. An example is provided to illustrate the design and implementation process in ReachLab.},
